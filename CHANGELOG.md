    ([tx Andreas Gerstlauer](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/commit/76b6306a40131cfc999457c247838e50cbb585c7))

  - DKIM: added ERROR_FD=2 in control/filterargs to send error output of qmail-dkim in stderr when acting
    as a qmail-remote filter ([Andreas Gerstlauer](https://www.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/configuring-dkim-for-qmail-92.html#comment4607))
  - improved qmail-dkim error reporting when signing outgoing messages ([Andreas Gerstlauer](https://www.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/configuring-dkim-for-qmail-92.html#comment4639))
  - helodnscheck.cpp: qmail dir determined dinamically
  - qmHandle: Add -x and -X parametr for remove email by To/Cc/Bcc (by [Stetinac](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmHandle/pull/1))
  - Added a cronjob for `rcptcheck-overlimit` that only removes cases that didn't exceed the limit, i.e. enforces a permanent ban ([tx Andreas Gerstlauer](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/commit/3ea54851acf4ff6d405b9e404e3f1fce9242d445))

- Jun 17, 2025
  - Fix for missing end of line in helodnscheck.cpp ([tx Andreas Gerstlauer](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/commit/a144829980fe1834d9b33ddc674b43e523d6d69f))

- Jun 8, 2025
  - CRLF fix for fastremote-3 patch ([thanks Andreas Gerstlauer](https://www.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/upgrading-qmail-82.html#comment4593))
  - Bug fix to the greetdelay program ([thanks Andreas Gerstlauer](https://www.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/upgrading-qmail-82.html#comment4597))  
    qmail-smtpd crashes if SMTPD_GREETDELAY is defined with no DROP_PRE_GREET defined.
  - turned off TLS and helo dns check on qmail-smtpsd/run script (tx Luis)

- Apr 25, 2025
  - added a configuration script [config-all.sh](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/blob/main/config-all.sh),
    which configure and installs the following:
    - main control files as per original `config-fast `script,
    - aliases,
    - RBL
    - SPF
    - SRS (uses _control/me_ as the _srs_domain_),
    - log dirs in _/var/log/qmail_, 
    - cronjobs
    - logrotate
    - PATH and MANPATH in _/etc/profile.d/qmail.sh_
    - tcprules (basic, just to make initial tests), 
    - supervise scripts, 
    - `qmailctl` script, 
    - DKIM _control/filterargs_ and _control/domainkeys_ dir, 
    - SURBL, 
    - moreipme,
    - overlimit feature
    - smtpplugins, 
    - `helodnscheck` spp plugin, 
    - `svtools`, 
    - `qmHandle`, 
    - `queue-repair`, 
    - SSL key file (optional)

Running `./config-all mx.mydomain.tld` after the compilation will get the `qmail` installation ready for testing.  
Those who prefer to manually configure everything can stick with the original `config-fast` script, which now copies
my supervise scripts to the _qmail/doc_ dir.  
Consider this feature as testing.

  - Several adjustments to get freeBSD and netBSD compatibility. More info in the commit history.
    Hints/comments are welcome.
  - freeBSD users have to comment out the "LIBRESOLV" variable from the very beginning of the
    Makefile, as libresolv.so in not needed on freeBSD.
  - Dropped files install-big.c, idedit.c and BIN.* files.
  - Dropped files byte_diff.c, str_cpy.c, str_diff.c, str_diffn.c and str_len.c, which break compilation
    on clang and can be replaced by the functions shipped by the compiler (tx notqmail).
  - Old documentation moved to the "doc" dir. install.c and hier.c modified accordingly
  - conf-cc and conf-ld now have -L/usr/local/lib and -I/usr/local/include to look for srs2 library
  - conf-cc and conf-ld now have -L/usr/pkg/lib and -I/usr/pkg/include to satisfy netBSD
  - vpopmail-dir.sh: minor correction to vpopmail dir existence check
  - srs.c: #include <srs2.h> now without path

- Dec 01, 2024
  - Added support for EAI ([RFC 5336](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5336) SMTP Email Address Internationalization)
    (https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/pull/13).  
    Thanks to https://github.com/arnt/qmail-smtputf8/tree/smtputf8-tls.
  - chkuser is now smtputf8 compliant. It accepts utf8 characters in sender and recipient addresses provided that the
    remote server advertises the SMTPUTF8 verb in MAIL FROM, otherwise it allows only ASCII characters plus additional
    chars from the CHKUSER_ALLOWED_CHARS set.  More info [here](https://www.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/email-address-internationalization-for-qmail-mav-from-chkuser-modified-accordingly-308.html)  
    - dropped variables CHKUSER_ALLOW_SENDER_CHAR_xx CHKUSER_ALLOW_RCPT_CHAR_xx (replaced by CHKUSER_ALLOWED_CHARS)
    - dropped variables CHKUSER_ALLOW_SENDER_SRS and CHKUSER_ALLOW_RCPT_SRS, as we are always accepting '+' and '#' characters
    - added variables CHKUSER_INVALID_UTF8_CHARS and CHKUSER_ALLOWED_CHARS  
  - fixed compilation warnings due to deprecated SSL_CTX_use_RSAPrivateKey_file and SSL_use_RSAPrivateKey_file functions

- Oct 26, 2024
  - qmail-remote.c patched to dinamically touch control/notlshosts/\<fqdn\> if control/notlshosts_auto contains any
    number greater than 0 in order to skip the TLS connection for remote servers with an obsolete TLS version.  
    (tx Alexandre Fonceca)
  - fixed several compilation breaks/warnings on later gcc compilers (tx Pablo Murillo)
  - invalid auth fix in qmail-smtpd.c's smtp_auth function (tx Alexandre Fonceca for the advice)
  - qmail path determined dinamically in conf-policy
  - added a patch to remove chkuser and the vpopmail dependency (other-patches dir)

- Jun 8, 2024
  - conf-channels: default number of channels increased to 4 (was 2). Now qmail offers 2 additional channels
    with respect to the 2 offered by default (local and remote). More info [here](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/blob/main/CHANNELS).
  - maxrcpt: error code changed to 452 due to RFC 4.5.3.1 (was 553). If DISABLE_MAXRCPT is defined it skips the check,
    otherwise outgoing messages from mailing lists would be rejected. ([commit](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/commit/87fac634ddf3f4eb09d5fdc45e1a8bc4c10de2f9))

- May 16, 2024
  - DKIM: Make the dkimsign binary _not_ derive the "d=" domain value from the Return-Path header ([tx mpdude](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/pull/5))
  - Fixed -Wstringop-overflow on qmail-start.c line 128 (gcc-13.2) ([commit](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/commit/e5af0129bae6d19525ba8a2e750b9264139739c6))
  - Fixed -Wincompatible-pointer-types compilation warnings onsubstdio.h ([commit](https://github.com/sagredo-dev/qmail/commit/67bdb4bc109ef628733039270ab25daece4afe8c))
  - Big Concurrency fix patch removed, as it is incompatible with the above change.
  - Create a trigger to decide if your qmail-smtpd instance should respect badmailfrom regex or not. This could be very handling if you decide to have very
    strict rules for your qmail-smtpd that you donÂ´t want to be applied to qmail-submission. Usage: add export DISABLE_BADMAILFROM=1 to run file service

  - liberal-lf: bare LF no longer allowed due to smuggling vulnerability ([CVE-2023-51765](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51765)). Enable bare LF by defining ALLOW_BARELF in tcprules or in run file.

  - TLS patch by F. Vermeulen upgraded to version 20231230 (more info at https://inoa.net/qmail-tls/)

    - The variables USE_FROM, USE_SENDER and DKIMDOMAIN have been dropped

    - In case of ordinary bounces (mailbox not found, for instance) the bounce domain will be taken from control/bouncehost and, if doesn't exist, from control/me
    - More info [here](https://www.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/configuring-dkim-for-qmail-92.html#signing_remote)

- 2023.03.01
  - Added qmail-1.03-fastremote-3 qmail-remote patch (tx Ali Erturk TURKER for the advice)
 While sending individual messages with qmail consumes very little CPU, sending multiple large messages in parallel can effectively DoS a sender
 due to inefficiencies in qmail-remote's "blast" function. In its original form, this function scans the message one byte at a time to escape
 leading periods and newlines, as required by SMTP.
 This patch modifies blast to scan the message in larger chunks. I have benchmarked before and after, and the change reduced the CPU time
 consumed by qmail-remote by a factor of 10.
