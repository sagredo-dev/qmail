-dkim:
 * The patch now by default excludes X-Arc-Authentication-Results
 * dkim can additionally use the environment variable EXCLUDE_DKIMSIGN to include colon separated list of

 it overrides the value of EXCLUDE_DKIMSIGN.

2023.03.01
-Added qmail-1.03-fastremote-3 qmail-remote patch (tx Ali Erturk TURKER for the advice)
 While sending individual messages with qmail consumes very little CPU, sending multiple large messages in parallel can effectively DoS a sender
 due to inefficiencies in qmail-remote's "blast" function. In its original form, this function scans the message one byte at a time to escape
 leading periods and newlines, as required by SMTP.
 This patch modifies blast to scan the message in larger chunks. I have benchmarked before and after, and the change reduced the CPU time
 consumed by qmail-remote by a factor of 10.
