If you have glibc-2.3.1 or later then none of the software written by
djb will compile because of an incompatible declaration of errno.

Here you can find patches correcting this problem for software likely
you need if you run qmail.

To use the patches
==================

From the top distribution directory, apply the appropriate errno patch
with -p1.  So, for example, for mess822, you would do

tar zxvf mess822-0.58.tar.gz
cd mess822-0.58
patch -p1 < /path/to/mess822-0.58.errno.patch

In case of daemontools, you need the following adjustment:

tar zxvf daemontools-0.76.tar.gz
cd admin/daemontools-0.76
patch -p1 /path/to/daemontools-0.76.errno.patch

Notes
-----

ucspi-tcp: 

	In addition to the errno patch, there are two other patches
	included here; both update rblsmtpd's behavior to current
	practices on the net.

	The a_record patch allows you to specify the error that will
	be returned by rblsmtpd for a zone that has only A records in
	it.

	The nodefaultrbl patch changes the behavior of rblsmtpd so
	that if no `-r' flag is given, than instead of falling back to
	rbl.maps.vix.com as the default RBL, rblsmtpd assumes that no
	RBL is to be used.

qmailanalog:

	In addition to the required errno change, the qmailanalog
	patch also changes qmailanalog to accept both tai and tai64n
	times.  This is necessary because djb never updated qmailanalog
	after he changed daemontools to tai64n.

These notes were originally written by Mate Wierdl, and have been
modified for this distribution by Russell Nelson, and then were rewritten
by Mate again, and then added to by Russell Nelson.
